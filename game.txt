Basic Game Mechanics
    Hardware:
        Cluster:
            Notes:
                Group of one or more servers.
                Independent from any other clusters.
                A player may own any number of clusters.
                Location of cluster determines maximum number of servers.
                Cluster specs are cummulative of all the servers that compose it.
                Internet/Network specs are per cluster.
            Locations:
                Default:
                    Name:
                    
                    Maximum server amount:
                    
                Location 1:
                    Name:
                        
                    Maximum server amount:
                        
        Server:
            Notes:
                A group of servers comprises a cluster.
                Upgradable unit.
                Servers cannot be moved between clusters.
                Parts: CPU, Memory, Storage.

    Files:
        Exploit Kit:
            Notes:
                Hacks access into cluster with active firewall that is lower level than exploit kit.
        Cracker:
            Notes:
                Hacks access, and gives cluster password, of server with encrypter that is lower level than cracker.
                Get decryption code of file that is encrypted by crypter that is lower level than the cracker.
                Crack Proxy malware proxy code.
                Multi-usage -- Take (much) longer as penalty?
		When hacking, notify victim of hack in progress in logs.
        Firewall:
            Notes:
                Prevents access to cluster by use of exploit kit that is lower level than firewall.
        Crypter:
            Notes:
                Prevents access to cluster by use of cracker that is lower level than Crypter.
        Scanner:
            Notes:
                Gives cluster specs of cluster that user has access to.
		Shows accesses to cluster that user has access to.
                Shows proxy connections of a cluster.
        Activators:
            Collector Activator:
                Notes:

        DDoS Malware:
        Proxy Malware:
        Anti-Malware:
            Notes:
                Removes malware that is lower level than anti-malware.
                Quickly remove malware with removal code.
Other Mechanics:
    Logs:
        Anytime a cluster performs an action, or has an action performed on it, the log file will be changed to reflect that.
        Log file cannot be encrypted.
    Password File:
        Each cluster has a password file that is encrypted automatically with the highest crypter.
        If anyone gets the unencrypted password, they can use it to get access into servers.
        Password file cannot be deleted.
        Password file cannot be manually encrypted.
    Database File:
        Every bank account or cluster that the cluster has hacked, along with the password, if any, will be added into the database file.
        Every malware that the cluster has installed, the removal code will be added into the database file.
        The Database File is automatically encrypted with the highest crypter.
        Fo all encryptions performed by the player, the decryption code will be in the database file.
        If anyone gets the unencrypted database, they can import it into their own.
        Database file cannot be deleted.
        Database file cannot be manually encrypted.
    Proxy Server:
        When a player has a proxy malware installed on a cluster, they can use the proxy malware's proxy code to cause that server to act as a proxy.
    Malware Installation:
        When a player installs a malware, they will recieve a removal code that can be used to remove the malware.
    Malware Removal:
        A player can use a removal code to remove a malware.
        A player can use an anti-malware to remove a malware.
        A player can use an anti-malware with a removal code to quickly remove the malware.
    Encyption:
        A player can encrypt a file, rendering it unusable, and recieving a decryption code using a crypter.
    Decryption:
        A player can use a decryption code to invert the encryption, using a decryption code and a crypter.
        A decryption code can be cracked by a cracker.
    Process tasking:
        Each action will take time to prepare, and when done, the next action in queue will begin to prepare.
        When an action, or process, is prepared, the player can choose to activate it.
        Each cluster will have its own queue.
